# Bank-Reviews-Classification
This project is aimed to classify different russian bank reviews by positive or negative attitude

In this project I will use some parcing skills to get data from the cite "Banki.ru". After that, I'll continue my work with data preprocessing by using lemmatizing, tokenizing, cleaning data from stopwords and incorrect symbols using natural language processing (NLP). Then, I'll implement some classical machine learning models as well as a simple neural network. By the end, I'll esstimate the best model on the test dataset. Moreover, I'll make up some new examples of reviews and check out can my model handle this new data successfully.
